The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.2.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

The major changes compared to the Horde version H3 (3.2-ALPHA) are:
    * Added more sounds for alarm notifications.
    * Added a JSON RPC backend.
    * Stabilized Kolab support.
    * Improved Horde_Image library.
    * Fixed share caching.
    * Many further bugfixes and improvements.
