The Horde Project is a group of developers who write web applications using
the Horde Application Framework, itself a product of the project.

The Horde Application Framework is a flexible, modular, general-purpose web
application framework written in PHP. It provides an extensive array of
components that are targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in
developing modern web applications: libraries for dealing with preferences,
compression, browser detection, connection tracking, MIME, and more.

The Horde Framework, by itself, does not provide any significant end user
functionality; it provides a base for other applications and tools for
developers. You will probably want to install some of the available Horde
applications, such as IMP (a webmail client), or Kronolith (a calendar). There
is a list of Horde applications and projects at http://www.horde.org/apps.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.
